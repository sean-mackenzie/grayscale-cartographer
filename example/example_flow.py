Some important notes:
    
    1. On "Design Labels" or 'design_lbls':
        * if a wafer only has a single design, then features will be identified by 'a1', 'c2', etc...
        * if a wafer has multiple designs, the 'design_lbls' get attached to the feature labels, 'a1_LrO' or 'a1_erf5'
    2. On "Target Labels" or 'target_lbls':
        * the string 'target-profile_' is inserted before the design label, or 'design_lbl'. The target label doesn't
        really serve a purpose at this point. The 'design file' (x, y, r, l) and 'target profile' (r, z) should be
        combined. 
    3. On design spacing and design locations:
        * 'design_spacing' is primarily used to filter multiple peaks in a single scan. 
        * 'design_locs' isn't really used at this point. 
        * 'design_spacing' should be removed as an input and calculated using 'design_locs'.
